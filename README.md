A JavaScript Calculator

This [calculator](https://github.com/bauhouse/freecodecamp-challenges/tree/master/frontend/projects/calculator) started out as a challenge on freeCodeCamp.
I have been tracking my [progress](https://github.com/bauhouse/freecodecamp-challenges/) as a full stack developer on GitHub.
I posted the results of my [calculator](https://codepen.io/bauhouse/pen/EREbwN) experiment to Codepen.
Then, I discovered Glitch through freeCodeCamp. Now, I am wondering whether I can host my experiment there.
