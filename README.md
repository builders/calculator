A JavaScript Calculator

This [calculator](https://github.com/bauhouse/freecodecamp-challenges/tree/master/frontend/projects/calculator) started out as a challenge on freeCodeCamp.
I have been tracking my [progress](https://github.com/bauhouse/freecodecamp-challenges/) as a full stack developer on GitHub.
I posted the results of my [calculator](https://codepen.io/bauhouse/pen/EREbwN) experiment to Codepen.
Then, I discovered Glitch through freeCodeCamp. Now, I am wondering whether I can host my experiment there.

## [Build a JavaScript Calculator](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator)

- Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/.
- Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
- User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
- User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.
- User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
- Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
- When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
- You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
